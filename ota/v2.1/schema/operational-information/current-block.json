This is usually a result of what was proposed by the driver on-board (see ruter/{PTO}/{vehicleID}/di/assignment_attempt/block) and then confirmed as valid by the back-office. It could also be based on an overriding decision enforced by the operation control centre.\n\nNote that if a ruter/{PTO}/{vehicleID}/di/assignment_attempt/block is not answered by the back-office within a configured duration it is assumed that contact is lost with the control centre and then the proposed block will be accepted and exposed on this topic.\n\n",
